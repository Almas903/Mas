Cloud computing refers the practice of using computer resources that do not reside on the hard drive in your desktop machine or laptop, or on the corporate server, but on the remote computing infrastructure that loosely comprises the network we call the internet.
For example, if you have a free e-mail account set up with MSN, Yahoo!, or a similar service provider, your e-mail messages are stored in ‘the cloud’.
Anybody with a computer, an internet service provider, and (preferably a broadband) telephone line can access the software and data in the cloud using a browser from anywhere they happen to be, any time it suits them. Instead of costly software license fees, users pay a small monthly subscription – and the service provider takes care of software maintenance, upgrades, and the various processes associated with keeping data safe and secure.
This can provide individuals and small organizations with access to powerful software and systems that would once have been the preserve of large organizations with substantial financial and technical resources.
